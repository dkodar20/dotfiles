Nvim setup steps for CP (on mac)
- Install coc.nvim and coc-clangd for autocompletion (also install clangd using brew)
- Install gcc using brew (mac default gcc redirects to clang)
- brew installed g++ should already have bits/stdc++.h header
- To edit it for debugging logs, the location for header file is
  `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/13.2.0/include/c++/13/aarch64-apple-darwin22`
- Add the debug.h at `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/13.2.0/include/c++/13`
- Auto completion using clangd will still give error on bits/stdc++.h
- To fix that add the bits/stdc++.h header where clang headers are located
  `/usr/local/include`
(I guess a better way would be to make brew's gcc use system headers as well
and just include the headers in /usr/local/include)
